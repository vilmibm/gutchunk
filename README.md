# gutchunk

this is code I used to process about 12gb of plaintext books from Project Gutenberg.

it assumes a mirror of gutenberg books made using their [robot access](https://gutenberg.org/policy/robot_access.html) endpoint.

so far the output of this is being used on [blackout](https://blackout.tilde.town).

if you're a townie and want access to the database i made using this lmk.
